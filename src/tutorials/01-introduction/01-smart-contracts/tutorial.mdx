# Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are written by extending the base class **SmartContract** :
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```
Interaction with a smart contract happens by calling one or more of its methods. You declare methods using the **@method** decorator:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @method myMethod(x: Field) {
    x.mul(2).assertEquals(5);
  }
}
```
# Update the state
Our goal is when the 'update' method is called, the Add contract adds Field(2) to its 'num' contract state.

We can update our current state using the **add** method :
```ts
const newState = currentState.add(2);
```
And update the state of **num** with our new state:
```ts
this.num.set(newState);
```
