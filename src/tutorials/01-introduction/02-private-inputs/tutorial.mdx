# Private Inputs
Now, we will add an **initState()** method. This is intended to run once to set up the initial state on the zkApp account :
```ts
  @method initState(salt: Field, firstSecret: Field) {
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash([ salt, firstSecret ]));
  }
```
Note that these inputs to our **initState()** method are private to whomever initializes the contract. Nobody looking at the zkApp account on the chain can see or know what values **firstSecret** or **salt** actually are.
```ts
  @method incrementSecret(salt: Field, secret: Field) {
    const x = this.x.get();
    this.x.assertEquals(x);

    Poseidon.hash([salt, secret]).assertEquals(x);
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash([salt, secret.add(1)]));
  }
```
# Poseidon
Mina uses the Poseidon hash function, which has been optimized for fast performance inside zero knowledge proof systems. The Poseidon hash function takes in an array of Fields, and returns a single Field as output.

In this smart contract, we use both a secret number, and a second Field, known as a "salt".
