# o1js Basic Concepts

## Field

Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero-knowledge proof programming. Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size. You can think of it as a uint256 in Solidity.

For example, in typical programming, you might use:
```ts
const sum = 1 + 3.
```
In o1js, you write this as:
```ts
const sum = new Field(1).add(new Field(3))
```
This can be simplified as:
```ts
const sum = new Field(1).add(3)
```
Note that the 3 is auto-promoted to a field type to make this cleaner.

## Built-in data types

Some common data types you may use are:

```ts
new Bool(x);   // accepts true or false
new Field(x);  // accepts an integer, or a numeric string if you want to represent a number greater than JavaScript can represent but within the max value that a field can store.
new UInt64(x); // accepts a Field - useful for constraining numbers to 64 bits
new UInt32(x); // accepts a Field - useful for constraining numbers to 32 bits
```

In the case of ***Field*** and ***Bool***, you can also call the constructor without ***new***:

### Tutorial
In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of adding log statements for the variables: ***sum***, ***bool***, ***int32***, ***int64*** so you can see the underlying values.

Add the following log statements:
```ts
Provable.log("sum has the value:", sum)
Provable.log("bool has the value:", bool)
Provable.log("int32 has the value:", int32)
Provable.log("int64 has the value", int64)
```
