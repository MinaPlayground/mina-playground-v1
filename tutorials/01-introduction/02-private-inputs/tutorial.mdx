# Private Inputs
In this tutorial, we will discuss private inputs and hash functions. With a zkApp, a user's local device generates one or more zero knowledge proofs, which are then verified by the Mina network. Each method in a SnarkyJS smart contract corresponds to constructing a proof.

As such, all inputs to a smart contract are private by default, and never seen by the blockchain, unless the developer chooses to store those values as on-chain state in the zkApp account. We will build a smart contract with a piece of private state, that can be modified if a user knows the private state.

Now, we will add an **initState()** method. This is intended to run once to set up the initial state on the zkApp account :
```ts
@method initState(salt: Field, firstSecret: Field) {
  this.x.set(Poseidon.hash([ salt, firstSecret ]));
}
```
Our **initState()** method accepts our secret, and a value called a "salt", which we will discuss later. Note that these inputs to our **initState()** method are private to whomever initializes the contract. Nobody looking at the zkApp account on the chain can see or know what values **firstSecret** or **salt** actually are.

# Update with Poseidon

Next we will add a method to update our state:
```ts
@method incrementSecret(salt: Field, secret: Field) {
  const x = this.x.get();
  this.x.assertEquals(x);

  Poseidon.hash([salt, secret]).assertEquals(x);
  this.x.set(Poseidon.hash([salt, secret.add(1)]));
}
```
Mina uses the Poseidon hash function, which has been optimized for fast performance inside zero knowledge proof systems. The Poseidon hash function takes in an array of Fields, and returns a single Field as output.

In this smart contract, we use both a secret number, and a second Field, known as a "salt".

In the **incrementSecret()** method, we check that the hash of the salt and our secret is equal to the current state **x**. If this is the case, we add **1** to the secret and set **x** to the hash of the salt and this new secret. SnarkyJS creates a proof of this fact, and a JSON description of the state updates to be made on the zkApp account, such as to store our new hash value, which together form a transaction that can be sent to the Mina network to update the zkApp account.

Because zkApp smart contracts are run off chain, our salt and secret remain private and are never transmitted anywhere. Only the result, updating **x** on-chain state to **hash([ salt, secret + 1])** is revealed. Because the salt and secret can't be deduced from their hash, they remain private.
