## Common methods

Some common methods you will use often are:

```ts
let x = new Field(4); // x = 4
x = x.add(3); // x = 7
x = x.sub(1); // x = 6
x = x.mul(3); // x = 18
x = x.div(2); // x = 9
x = x.square(); // x = 81
x = x.sqrt(); // x = 9

let b = x.equals(8); // b = Bool(false)
b = x.greaterThan(8); // b = Bool(true)
b = b.not().or(b).and(b); // b = Bool(true)
b.toBoolean(); // true
```

### Tutorial

Create a mutable variable ***x*** for a Field that has a default value of 1:

```ts
let x = Field(1);
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by adding 2 to our ***Field***:

```ts
x = x.add(2); // x is now 3 since 1 + 2 = 3
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by subtracting 1 from our ***Field***:

```ts
x = x.sub(1); // x is now 2 since 3 - 1 = 2
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by multiplying our ***Field*** with 2:

```ts
x = x.mul(2); // x is now 4 since 2 * 2 = 4
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by dividing our ***Field*** with 2:

```ts
x = x.div(2); // x is now 2 since 4 / 2 = 2
```

We can log the value of ***x*** to check that it has been changed with the following methods: ***add***, ***sub***, ***mul*** and ***div***:
```ts
Provable.log('x is now:', x) // should be 2
```

We can also use ***equals*** to check if our variable ***x*** is equal to a specific value, add the following:
```ts
let b = x.equals(3); // b is false since x is equal to 2
```

Mutate the variable ***b*** using ***greaterThan***:
```ts
b = x.greaterThan(2) // b is false since x is not greater than 2
```

We can log the value of ***b*** to check that it has been set to ***false***:
```ts
Provable.log('b is now:', b) // should be false
```

We have three essential operators: ***and***, ***or*** and ***not***.
***and*** requires both conditions to be true, ***or*** permits at least one condition to be true, and ***not*** negates a statement, flipping it from true to false or vice versa. Add the following:
```ts
let c = b.not()
let d = b.not().or(b)
let e = b.not().and(b)
```

We can now log the values of ***c***, ***d*** and ***e***:
```ts
Provable.log('c is now:', c) // should be true
Provable.log('d is now:', d) // should be true
Provable.log('e is now:', e) // should be false
```
