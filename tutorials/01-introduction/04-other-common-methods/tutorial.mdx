## Common methods

Some common methods you will use often are:

```ts
let x = new Field(4); // x = 4
x = x.add(3); // x = 7
x = x.sub(1); // x = 6
x = x.mul(3); // x = 18
x = x.div(2); // x = 9
x = x.square(); // x = 81
x = x.sqrt(); // x = 9

let b = x.equals(8); // b = Bool(false)
b = x.greaterThan(8); // b = Bool(true)
b = b.not().or(b).and(b); // b = Bool(true)
b.toBoolean(); // true

const hash = Poseidon.hash([x]); // takes array of Fields, returns Field

const privKey = PrivateKey.random(); // create a private key
const pubKey = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(privKey); // derive public key
const msg = [hash];
const sig = Signature.create(privKey, msg); // sign a message
const isVerified = sig.verify(pubKey, msg); // Bool(true)
```

### Tutorial

Create a mutable variable ***x** for a Field that has a default value of 1:

```ts
let x = Field(1);
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by adding 2 to our ***Field***:

```ts
x = x.add(2); // x is now 3 since 1 + 2 = 3
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by subtracting 1 from our ***Field***:

```ts
x = x.sub(1); // x is now 2 since 3 - 1 = 2
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by multiplying our ***Field*** with 2:

```ts
x = x.mul(2); // x is now 4 since 2 * 2 = 4
```

Mutate the variable ***x*** by dividing our ***Field*** with 2:

```ts
x = x.div(2); // x is now 2 since 4 / 2 = 2
```

We can log the value of ***x*** to check that it has been changed with the following methods: ***add***, ***sub***, ***mul*** and ***div***:
```ts
Provable.log('x is now:', x) // should be 2
```

We can log the value of ***x*** to check that it has been changed with the following methods: ***add***, ***sub***, ***mul*** and ***div***:
```ts
Provable.log('x is now:', x) // should be 2
```


We can also log the value of the ***isVerified*** variable to check that we have successfully signed and verified the message:
```ts
Provable.log('is signature verified:', isVerified) // should be true
```
