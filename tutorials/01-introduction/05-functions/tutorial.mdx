## Functions

Functions work as you would expect in TypeScript. For example:

```ts
function addOneAndDouble(x: Field): Field {
  return x.add(1).mul(2);
}
```
Here we take the input ***x***, add 1 to the Field value, multiply it by two and return the new Field.

### Tutorial

Let's first call the ***addOneAndDouble*** function with our defined Field ***x*** and call the result ***y***:
```ts
const y = addOneAndDouble(x);
```

Now check if our ***y*** field is equal to the value of 4:
```ts
const isEqual = y.equals(4);
```

Log the variables ***y*** and ***isEqual***:
```ts
Provable.log("y is:", y);
Provable.log("y is equal to 4:", isEqual);
```
