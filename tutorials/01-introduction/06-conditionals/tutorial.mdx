## Conditionals

Traditional conditional statements are not supported by o1js:

```ts
// this will NOT work
if (foo) {
  x.assertEquals(y);
}
```

Instead, use the o1js built-in Provable.if() method, which is a ternary operator:

```ts
const x = Provable.if(new Bool(foo), a, b); // behaves like `foo ? a : b`
```

### Tutorial

Add the o1js built-in Provable.if() method:

```ts
const x = Provable.if(new Bool(foo), a, b);
```

Log the result of the ternary operator, which should now be 1:
```ts
Provable.log("x is now:", x)
```

Set the ***Bool*** value of the variable ***foo*** to ***false***:
```ts
const foo = Bool(false);
```
The result of the ternary operator should now be 2.
