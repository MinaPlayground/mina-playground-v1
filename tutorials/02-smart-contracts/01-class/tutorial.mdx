# Smart Contracts
Now that we have covered the basics of writing o1js programs, let's see how to create a smart contract.

## SmartContract

Smart contracts are written by extending the base class ***SmartContract***:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```

The ***constructor*** of a ***SmartContract*** is inherited from the base class and should not be overriden. It takes the zkApp account address (a public key) as its only argument:
```ts
let zkAppKey = PrivateKey.random();
let zkAppAddress = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(zkAppKey);

let zkApp = new HelloWorld(zkAppAddress);
```

Later, you learn how to deploy a smart contract to an on-chain account.

NOTE: On Mina, there is no strong distinction between normal "user accounts" and "zkApp accounts". A zkApp account is just a normal account that has a smart contract deployed to it â€“ which essentially just means there's a verification key stored on the account, which can verify zero-knowledge proofs generated with the smart contract.

### Tutorial

Add the following ***Class*** definition:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {}
```

Declare a variable ***zkAppKey*** and generate a private key using the ***random*** method on the ***PrivateKey*** class:
```ts
const zkAppKey = PrivateKey.random();
```

Declare a variable ***zkAppAddress*** by deriving a public key from the private key using the ***fromPrivateKey*** method on the ***PublicKey*** class:
```ts
let zkAppAddress = PublicKey.fromPrivateKey(zkAppKey);
```

Declare a variable ***zkApp*** and instantiate the HelloWorld class, providing zkAppAddress as an input parameter.
```ts
let zkApp = new HelloWorld(zkAppAddress);
```

Log our instantiated HelloWorld class:
```ts
Provable.log(zkApp)
```
