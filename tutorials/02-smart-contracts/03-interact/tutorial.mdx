# Interact with a smart contract
Next, write a script that interacts with your smart contract. Follow these steps to build the ***main.ts*** file so you can can interact with the smart contract.


# Imports
For this tutorial, the ***import*** statement brings in items from ***o1js*** that you use to interact with your smart contract.

Copy the following lines into the ***main.ts*** file:

```ts
import { Square } from './Square.js';
import {
  Field,
  Mina,
  PrivateKey,
  AccountUpdate,
} from 'o1js';
```

These import items are:

* ***isReady***: An asynchronous promise that resolves when o1js is loaded and ready. This field is required because o1js contains WebAssembly (Wasm).
* ***shutdown***: A function that closes the program.
* ***Field***: The same o1js unsigned integer type that you learned earlier.
* ***Mina***: A local Mina blockchain to deploy the smart contract to so you can interact with it as a user would.
* ***PrivateKey***: A class with functions for manipulating private keys.
* ***AccountUpdate***: A class that generates a data structure that can update zkApp accounts.

# Local Blockchain
Using a local blockchain speeds up development and tests the behavior of your smart contract locally. Later tutorials cover how to deploy a zkApp to live Mina networks.

To initialize your local blockchain, add the following code to ***main.ts***:

```ts
console.log('o1js loaded');
const useProof = false;
const Local = Mina.LocalBlockchain({ proofsEnabled: useProof });
Mina.setActiveInstance(Local);
const { privateKey: deployerKey, publicKey: deployerAccount } = Local.testAccounts[0];
const { privateKey: senderKey, publicKey: senderAccount } = Local.testAccounts[1];
console.log('Shutting down');
```

This local blockchain also provides pre-funded accounts. These lines create local test accounts with test MINA to use for this tutorial:

```ts
const { privateKey: deployerKey, publicKey: deployerAccount } = Local.testAccounts[0];
const { privateKey: senderKey, publicKey: senderAccount } = Local.testAccounts[1];
```

# Build and run the smart contract
Now that the Square smart contract is complete, these commands run your project as a local blockchain.

To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:

```shell
npm run build
```

To run the JavaScript code:

```shell
node build/src/main.js
```

You have the option to combine these commands into one line:

```shell
npm run build && node build/src/main.js
```

* The ***npm run build*** command creates JavaScript code in the ***build*** directory.
* The ***&&*** operator links two commands together. The second command runs only if the first command is successful.
* The ***node build/src/main.js*** command runs the code in ***src/main.ts***.
