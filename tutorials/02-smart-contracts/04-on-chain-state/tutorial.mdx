# State

A smart contract can contain ***on-chain state***, which is declared as a property on the class with the ***@state*** decorator:

```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();
}
```

Here, ***x*** is of type ***Field***. Like with method inputs, only o1js structs can be used for state variables. In the current design, the state can consist of at most 8 Fields of 32 bytes each. These states are stored on the zkApp account. Some structs take up more than one Field: for example, a PublicKey needs 2 of the 8 Fields. States are initialized with the ***State()*** function.

A method can modify on-chain state by using the ***set()*** method:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  @method setX(x: Field) {
    this.x.set(x);
  }
}
```

As a zkApp developer, if you add this method to your smart contract, you are saying: "Anyone can call this method, to set ***x*** on the account to any value they want."

### Tutorial

Add the following ***Class*** definition:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  @method setX(x: Field) {
    this.x.set(x);
  }
}
```

Add our local blockchain implementation so we can interact with our Smart Contract:
```ts
const useProof = false;
const Local = Mina.LocalBlockchain({ proofsEnabled: useProof });
Mina.setActiveInstance(Local);
const { privateKey: deployerKey, publicKey: deployerAccount } = Local.testAccounts[0];
const { privateKey: senderKey, publicKey: senderAccount } = Local.testAccounts[1];
```

Initialize the Smart Contract and send the transaction:
```ts
const zkAppPrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
const zkAppAddress = zkAppPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
const zkAppInstance = new HelloWorld(zkAppAddress);
const deployTxn = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
  AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployerAccount);
  zkAppInstance.deploy();
});
await deployTxn.sign([deployerKey, zkAppPrivateKey]).send();
```

To update your local zkApp account with a transaction, add the following code:
```ts
const txn1 = await Mina.transaction(senderAccount, () => {
  zkAppInstance.setX(Field(9));
});
await txn1.prove();
const transaction = await txn1.sign([senderKey]).send();
```
This code creates a new transaction that attempts to update the field to the value ***9*** using the ***setX()*** function.

Now log the value of our transaction:
```ts
Provable.log(transaction)
```
Which will let you know that the transaction is successful.
