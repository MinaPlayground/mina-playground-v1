# Reading state

Often, we also want to read state – check out this example:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  @method increment() {
    // read state
    const x = this.x.get();
    this.x.assertEquals(x);

    // write state
    this.x.set(x.add(1));
  }
}
```

The ***increment()*** method fetches the current on-chain state ***x*** with ***this.x.get()***. Later, it sets the new state to ***x + 1*** using ***this.x.set()***. Simple!

There's another line though, which looks weird at first:

```ts
this.x.assertEquals(x);
```

To understand it, we have to take a step back, and understand what it means to "use an on-chain value" during off-chain execution.

For sure, when we use an on-chain value, we have to prove that this is the on-chain value. Verification has to fail if it's a different value! Otherwise, a malicious user could modify o1js and make it just use any other value than the current on-chain state – breaking our zkApp.

To prevent that, we link "***x*** at proving time" to be the same as "***x*** at verification time". We call this a precondition – a condition that is checked by the verifier (a Mina node) when it receives the proof in a transaction. This is what ***this.x.assertEquals(x)*** does: it adds the precondition that ***this.x*** – the on-chain state at verification time – has to equal ***x*** – the value we fetched from the chain on the client-side. In zkSNARK language, ***x*** becomes part of the public input.

Why didn't we just make ***this.x.get()*** add the precondition, automatically, so that you didn't have to write ***this.x.assertEquals(x)***? Well, we like to keep things explicit. The assertion reminds us that we add logic which can make the proof fail: If ***x*** isn't the same at verification time, the transaction will be rejected. So, reading on-chain values has to be done with care if many users are supposed to read and update state concurrently. It is applicable in some situations, but might cause races, and call for workarounds, in other situations. One such workaround is the use of actions.

### Tutorial

Add the following ***Class*** definition:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  @method increment() {
    const x = this.x.get();
    this.x.assertEquals(x);
    this.x.set(x.add(1));
  }
}
```

Add our local blockchain implementation so we can interact with our Smart Contract:
```ts
const useProof = false;
const Local = Mina.LocalBlockchain({ proofsEnabled: useProof });
Mina.setActiveInstance(Local);
const { privateKey: deployerKey, publicKey: deployerAccount } = Local.testAccounts[0];
const { privateKey: senderKey, publicKey: senderAccount } = Local.testAccounts[1];
```

Initialize the Smart Contract and send the transaction:
```ts
const zkAppPrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
const zkAppAddress = zkAppPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
const zkAppInstance = new HelloWorld(zkAppAddress);
const deployTxn = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
  AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployerAccount);
  zkAppInstance.deploy();
});
await deployTxn.sign([deployerKey, zkAppPrivateKey]).send();
```

To update your local zkApp account with a transaction, add the following code:
```ts
const txn1 = await Mina.transaction(senderAccount, () => {
  zkAppInstance.increment();
});
await txn1.prove();
const transaction = await txn1.sign([senderKey]).send();
```
This code creates a new transaction that attempts to increment the field ***x*** using the ***increment()*** function.

Now log the value of our transaction:
```ts
Provable.log(transaction)
```
Which will let you know that the transaction is successful.

Our state ***x*** starts with the value 0, change the ***assertEquals*** in the ***HelloWorld*** class to a different value:
```ts
this.x.assertEquals(Field(123));
```
Our comparison now fails because our current state value ***x*** is not equal to our defined value:
```ts
Error: [[],[["Account_app_state_precondition_unsatisfied",0]]]
```
