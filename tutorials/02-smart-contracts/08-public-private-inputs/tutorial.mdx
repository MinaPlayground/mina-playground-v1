# Public and private inputs

While the state of a zkApp is ***public***, method parameters are ***private***.

When a smart contract method is called, the proof it produces uses zero-knowledge to hide inputs and details of the computation.

The only way method parameters can be exposed is when the computation explicitly exposes them, as in the last example where the input was directly stored in the public state: ***this.x.set(xPlus1);***

For example where this is not the case, define a new method called ***incrementSecret()***:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

  // ...

  @method incrementSecret(secret: Field) {
    const x = this.x.get();
    this.x.requireEquals(x);

    Poseidon.hash(secret).assertEquals(x);
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash(secret.add(1)));
  }
}
```
This time, the input is called ***secret***. Check that the hash of the secret is equal to the current state ***x***. If this is the case, add 1 to the secret and set ***x*** to the hash of that.

When running this successfully, it just proves that the code was run with some input ***secret*** whose hash is ***x***, and that the new ***x*** is set to ***hash(secret + 1)***. However, the secret itself remains private, because it can't be deduced from its hash.

### Tutorial

Add the following ***Class*** definition:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) x = State<Field>();

   init() {
    super.init();
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash([Field(1)]));
  }

  @method incrementSecret(secret: Field) {
    const x = this.x.get();
    this.x.requireEquals(x);

    Poseidon.hash([secret]).assertEquals(x);
    this.x.set(Poseidon.hash([secret.add(1)]));
  }
}
```

Add our local blockchain implementation so we can interact with our Smart Contract:
```ts
const useProof = false;
const Local = Mina.LocalBlockchain({ proofsEnabled: useProof });
Mina.setActiveInstance(Local);
const { privateKey: deployerKey, publicKey: deployerAccount } = Local.testAccounts[0];
const { privateKey: senderKey, publicKey: senderAccount } = Local.testAccounts[1];
```

Initialize the Smart Contract and send the transaction:
```ts
const zkAppPrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
const zkAppAddress = zkAppPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
const zkAppInstance = new HelloWorld(zkAppAddress);
const deployTxn = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
  AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployerAccount);
  zkAppInstance.deploy();
});
await deployTxn.sign([deployerKey, zkAppPrivateKey]).send();
```

To update your local zkApp account with a transaction, add the following code:
```ts
const txn1 = await Mina.transaction(senderAccount, () => {
  zkAppInstance.incrementSecret(Field(1));
});
await txn1.prove();
const transaction = await txn1.sign([senderKey]).send();
```
This code creates a new transaction that attempts to increment the field ***x*** using the ***incrementSecret()*** function. It proves that the code was run with some input ***secret*** whose hash is ***x*** and that the new ***x*** is set to ***hash(secret + 1)***

Now log the value of our transaction:
```ts
Provable.log(transaction)
```
Which will let you know that the transaction is successful.

We can now execute another transaction and increment our input value:
```ts
const txn2 = await Mina.transaction(senderAccount, () => {
  zkAppInstance.incrementSecret(Field(2));
});
await txn2.prove();
const transaction2 = await txn2.sign([senderKey]).send();
```

Now log the value of our second transaction:
```ts
Provable.log(transaction2)
```
Which will let you know that the transaction is successful.

Both transactions are now successful:
```ts
{ isSuccess: true }
{ isSuccess: true }
```
