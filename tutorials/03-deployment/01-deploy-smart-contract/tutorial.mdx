# Methods

Interaction with a smart contract happens by calling one or more of its methods. You declare methods using the ***@method*** decorator:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
  @method myMethod(x: Field) {
    x.mul(2).assertEquals(5);
  }
}
```

Within a method, you can use o1js' data types and methods to define your custom logic.

Later, you learn how you can...

* run a method (off-chain)
* create a proof that it executed successfully
* send that proof to the Mina network, to trigger actions like a state change or payment

To get an idea what "successful execution" means, look at this line in our example above:
```ts
x.mul(2).assertEquals(5);
```

Creating a proof for this method is be possible only if the input ***x*** satisfies the equation ***x * 2 === 5***. This is called a "constraint". Magically, the proof can be checked without seeing ***x*** – it's a private input.

The method above is not very meaningful yet. To make it more interesting, you need a way to interact with accounts, and record state on-chain. Check out the next section for more on that!

One more note about private inputs: The method above has one input parameter, ***x*** of type ***Field***. In general, arguments can be any of the built-in o1js type that you saw: ***Bool***, ***UInt64***, ***PrivateKey***, etc. From now on, those types are referred to as structs`.

INFO: Under the hood, every ***@method*** defines a zk-SNARK circuit. From the cryptography standpoint, a smart contract is a collection of circuits, all of which are compiled into a single prover & verification key. The proof says something to the effect of "I ran one of these methods, with some private input, and it produced this particular set of account updates". In ZKP terms, the account updates are the public input. The proof will only be accepted on the network if it verifies against the verification key stored in the account. This ensures that indeed, the same code that the zkApp developer wrote also ran on the user's device – thus, the account updates conform to the smart contract's rules.

TIP: You will find that inside a ***@method***, things sometimes behave a little differently. For example, the following code can't be used in a method where ***x: Field*** is an input parameter:

### Tutorial

Add the following ***Class*** definition:
```ts
class HelloWorld extends SmartContract {
}
```

Add the following ***method*** to the HelloWorld class:
```ts
@method myMethod(x: Field) {
  x.mul(2).assertEquals(5);
}
```

Log our HelloWorld class definition:
```ts
Provable.log(HelloWorld)
```
Here you will find our class definition and the added ***method***:
```ts
_methods: [
    {
      methodName: 'myMethod',
      witnessArgs: [Array],
      proofArgs: [],
      allArgs: [Array],
      genericArgs: []
    }
  ],
```
